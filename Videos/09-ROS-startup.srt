1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
ROS environment startup
Realtime speed

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Using the manual approach where all nodes have to be started manually.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Only motion capture mocap_optitrack node is executed using launcher.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All nodes accept parameters. They are specific to the function of the node.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Communication node is started first.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Since there is connection to control node, the emergency procedure is executed.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Once the connection is established communication node continues to run in normal operation mode.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Preprocesser node is started. Notice that there is no output. This is due to lacking data from motion capture node.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Extended Kalman filter node is started. Since there is no input data, the estimates stay at a specific value.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The publish.sh script will be used to read logs and publish the data within using rostopic.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Start of visualization node.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Rollo is at origin of the coordinate system of motion capture.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Script for publishing is started. Preprocessor node receives data from mocap_optitrack node.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The actual position of Rollo is displayed. The odometry model has not been updated. The EKF node would have to be restarted for that.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Demonstration of different possibilities of the visualization node.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Different marker scale and frequency rate of visualization node are used.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Different refresh period of the plot is being used. Here movements can be tracked more easily at the cost of performance of the node.

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Demonstration of the control node. Pay attention to the output of communication node in the top right terminal.

19
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Again display of the emergency procedure of the communication node.
