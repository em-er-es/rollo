Realtime speed

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Movement mode: Forward
Velocities: L 19% R 12%

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Motion capture: Red marker; Extended Kalman filter: Blue marker; Odometry model: Green marker

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Odometry model was incorrect, since the velocities were switched for left and right wheel.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This resulted in movement of odometry into another direction.
