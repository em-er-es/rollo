00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Rollo run test 06: Random
Realtime speed

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Random movement demonstration

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Motion capture: Red marker; Extended Kalman filter: Blue marker; Odometry model: Green marker

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The visualization node actually plots a line with triangular markers.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That way after possible lost of signal or movement outside of regular area the previous position can be indicated.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Motion capture data not available at this moment. Rollo went outside of visible area.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Rollo is visible to motion capture system again. Odometry model goes outside of plot limits.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Backwards movement is of no issue to implemented extended Kalman filter.
