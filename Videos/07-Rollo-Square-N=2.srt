00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Rollo run test 07: Square test N=2
Realtime speed

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
01. Forward movement

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Motion capture: Red marker; Extended Kalman filter: Blue marker; Odometry model: Green marker

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Movement is done according to a specified time value, since direct odometry readings are not available.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
02. Turning 90°clockwise

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
03. Forward movement

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
04. Turning 90°clockwise

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
05. Forward movement

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
06. Turning 90°clockwise

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
07. Forward movement

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This turn was the worst so far. Often it is the result of uneven surface of the laboratory.

12
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
08. Turning 90°clockwise

13
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Square run 1 is finished. Square run 2 starts.

14
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
09. Turning around

15
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
10. Forward movement

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Motion capture lost the Rollo again. There was a recent recalibration of the whole motion capture system.

17
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
11. Turning 90°counterclockwise

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
12. Forward movement

19
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Motion capture data available again.

20
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
13. Turning 90°counterclockwise

21
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
14. Forward movement

22
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
15. Turning 90°counterclockwise

23
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
16. Forward movement

24
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
17. Turning 90°counterclockwise

25
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
18. Full stop

26
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Square run 2 is finished. The initial position indicated by the blue marker. Offset is approximately by 3 m.
