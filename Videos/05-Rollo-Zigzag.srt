Realtime speed

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Movement mode: Forward
Velocities: L 19% R 19%

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Motion capture: Red marker; Extended Kalman filter: Blue marker; Odometry model: Green marker

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Movement mode: Right rotation

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Rotation was not modeled into the odometry due to problems with surface and inconsistent movement of Rollo.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Movement mode: Forward
Velocities: L 19% R 19%

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Rotations in the visualization node are different from the physical ones, since the plotting area and recently recalibrated motion capture were mirrored.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Movement mode: Left rotation

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
