00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
01. Forward movement

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Motion capture: Red marker; Extended Kalman filter: Blue marker; Odometry model: Green marker

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Movement is done according to a specified time value, since direct odometry readings are not available.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
02. Turning 90째clockwise

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The rotation is clockwise, even though the visualization node indicates the opposite. This is due to recent calibration of system.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The visualization node was corrected afterwards.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
03. Forward movement

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
04. Turning 90째clockwise

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
05. Forward movement

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Too much rotation. Depending on grip and opposite force the rotation speed of Rollo changes drastically.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
06. Turning 90째clockwise

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
07. Forward movement

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
08. Turning 90째clockwise

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
09. Full stop
Square run 1 is finished. Position is off by approximately 2 m.
